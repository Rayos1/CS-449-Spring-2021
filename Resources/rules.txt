PLACE ALL OF YOUR PEICES ON THE BOARD AND ATTEMPT TO FORM A LINE OF 3
                        THAT IS A MILL.

ONCE A MILL IS FORMED YOU CAN REMOVE ONE OF YOUR OPPONENT'S PIECES.


PIECES IN OTHER MILL CANNONT BE REMOVED UNLESS NO OTHER PIECES ARE AVAILABLE


TO WIN YOU MUST LEAVE YOUR OPPONENT WITH NO MOVES OR 2 PIECES

                        GOOD LUCK!!!
