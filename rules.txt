Place all of your pieces on the board and attempt to form a line of 3.
                        That is a mill.

Once a mill is formed you can remove one of your opponent's pieces.


Pieces in other mill cannot be removed unless no other pieces are available.


To win you must leave your opponent with no moves or 2 pieces.

                        Good luck!!!
